# Chicago Apartment Finder

## About

Apartment hunting apps and websites are the worst. It's flooded with listings by corporate property managers who take forever to get in contact with. Even when you do find that perfect listing, you're often competing with dozens of others right away due to the sheer size of the user base.

Craiglist on the other hand is full of what I'd call "mom and pop" landlords that are easy to directly reach out to. What it lacks, however, is a decent notification system to alert you of a listing of your preferences.

Chicago Apartment Finder is a SlackBot that scrapes through Craigslist in the Chicagoland area and notifies you when a listing is found specific to your:

- Budget
- Desired areas
- Nearby "L" stations
